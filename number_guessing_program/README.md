# **Project Description**
The program generates a random number in the range from 1 to 100 and asks the user to guess the number.  If the user's guess is greater than a random number, the program should display the message *'Too much, try again'*.  If the guess is less than the random number, the program should display the message *'Too few, try again'*.  If the user guesses the number, then the program should congratulate him and display the message *'You guessed it, congratulations!'*.
